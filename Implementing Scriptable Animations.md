### User Input

awesome!!! i want to be able to script animations in the json... you think we can do something like that? like... for instance in jump.. the last two frames... i want to be able to slow down the frame rate.... but if I can do this, we might as well make it extensible to allow modifying other animations based in the json.. does this make sense?

*Edited relevant file*

*Edited relevant file*

### User Input

i have an idea for another extention.. for instance fall uses jump. what if the longer we fall the short the animation duration gets?

### User Input

we need to start modularizing the module... we need to make them builders so they can be reusable. like a unit. like how Diablo 2 uses teh Unit/Object/tile system. do not remove any feature we have. but I want to be able to enable/disbale sprite preview, the code in mib.rs is getting to be rather big. I want lib to just be the entry/setup
